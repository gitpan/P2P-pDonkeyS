==========================

pDonkeyS is perl implementation of eDonkey server. It is built upon
"Net::Server::Multiplex" and utilizes the power of MySQL for storing,

The main goal of the server is to provide framework for further eDonkey
protocol exploration, but it could be usefull in testing of client
software, since the server can be configured to output very detailed
debug info about eDonkey traffic.
